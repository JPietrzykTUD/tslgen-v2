# Post-M59 Planning Plus Review Prompt

You are planning the next redesign milestone after:

```text
Milestone 59: Size-Byte Equality Generation Branch-Chain Pruning Slice
```

Milestones 1 through 59 are accepted. M59 returned `Accept With Follow-Ups`
after one focused documentation revision. Do not implement code in this prompt.

The user asked that the next task focus on lowering. Prefer candidates that
advance the generation-time semantic lowering pipeline and keep it extendable
and maintainable.

## Read First

- `docs/agent/current-redesign-state.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `PLANS.md`
- `docs/agent/codex-workflow.md`
- `docs/agent/next-run-prompt-protocol.md`
- `docs/agent/review-checklist.md`
- `docs/agent/subagents/`
- `docs/redesign/implementation-roadmap.md`
- `docs/redesign/generation-time-semantic-lowering.md`
- `docs/redesign/behavioral-spec.md`
- `docs/redesign/pipeline-design.md`
- `docs/redesign/target-architecture.md`
- `docs/redesign/testing-strategy.md`
- `docs/redesign/open-questions.md`
- `docs/redesign/design-decisions.md`

## Planning Target

Select exactly one next milestone candidate for post-M59 execution.

The draft M60 candidate is:

```text
Draft Milestone 60: Opaque Selected Branch Body Handoff Slice
```

Treat M60 as a candidate, not as preaccepted. Compare it against other narrow
lowering-focused candidates that could reasonably follow M59. The selected
candidate should preserve the staged lowering direction:

```text
typed values -> typed predicates -> control-flow pruning -> selected-body handoff -> body-specific lowering
```

The planning result must define:

- milestone title and number
- goal
- scope
- out-of-scope items
- required inputs from accepted milestones
- expected typed outputs
- validation criteria
- tests required
- evidence paths
- review risks
- next concrete prompt path

## Boundary Rules

The next milestone must remain one thin architectural slice.

Do not select a milestone that combines selected-body handoff with:

- direct `intrin<...>` / SVE body lowering
- assignment, variable, array, call, cast, loop, or vector metadata lowering
- backend translation expansion
- rendering or generated output
- generated tests
- CLI/reporting/writer behavior
- Rust
- compiler execution
- broad TSIL parsing
- runtime dependency on `frozen/`
- lowering-time file reads, raw TSL parsing, or catalog queries during
  evaluation

If M60 is selected, keep it to an opaque typed selected-body handoff only. It
must not parse or lower the selected body semantics.

## Required Subagent Workflow

Use read-only planning and audit subagents before finalizing the plan:

1. Lowering planner: compare lowering-focused next milestones and recommend
   one candidate.
2. Boundary auditor: identify scope risks, especially M60 body handoff versus
   body lowering.
3. Evidence auditor: verify evidence paths and whether the candidate is
   supported by accepted M55-M59 behavior plus current corpus evidence.
4. Documentation auditor: check which roadmap/spec/testing docs need planning
   updates and whether any stale M59 wording remains.

After local planning updates, run read-only review subagents:

1. Reviewer: use `docs/agent/review-checklist.md` and return `Accept`,
   `Accept With Follow-Ups`, `Needs Revision`, `Return To Planner`, or
   `Reject`.
2. Boundary re-review: confirm the selected plan remains lowering-only and
   does not start implementation.
3. Documentation re-review: confirm docs and workflow state match the selected
   planning result.

If review returns `Needs Revision`, perform only focused documentation/planning
revisions and run focused re-review. Do not implement product code.

If review returns `Return To Planner` or `Reject`, stop and create the
appropriate next planning or rollback prompt under `docs/agent/runs/`.

## Required Repository Updates

Update planning documentation only as needed, usually:

- `docs/redesign/implementation-roadmap.md`
- `docs/redesign/generation-time-semantic-lowering.md`
- `docs/redesign/testing-strategy.md`
- `docs/redesign/behavioral-spec.md`
- `docs/redesign/pipeline-design.md`
- `docs/redesign/target-architecture.md`
- `docs/redesign/open-questions.md`
- `docs/redesign/design-decisions.md`

Before finishing, update `docs/agent/current-redesign-state.md` and create the
next concrete prompt under `docs/agent/runs/`.

If the planning result is internally accepted and needs human acceptance before
execution, create:

```text
docs/agent/runs/post-m59-acceptance-finalization-prompt.md
```

That finalization prompt should convert human acceptance into the selected
milestone execution-review loop prompt. Do not start execution here.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

If the planning pass changes only a subset of docs, include any narrower
diff-check command that was useful, but the final validation must include the
full `git diff --check`.

## Final Report

Report:

1. Planning and review subagents used.
2. Selected milestone and why it advances lowering.
3. Files changed.
4. Consolidated planning review verdict.
5. Follow-ups recorded, if any.
6. Next prompt created.
7. State transition made.
8. Validation command and exact result.
9. Whether the repo is ready for the next action.
