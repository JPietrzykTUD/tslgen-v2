# Post-M62 Planning Plus Review Prompt

You are planning the next redesign milestone after:

```text
Milestone 62: Selected Assignment Direct-Intrinsic Body IR Slice
```

Milestones 1 through 62 are accepted. M62 returned
`Accept With Follow-Ups` after one focused documentation revision. Do not
implement code in this prompt.

For the next task, focus on lowering. Prefer candidates that advance the
generation-time lowering pipeline from typed selected-body IR toward
maintainable body-specific lowering, while preserving staged boundaries.

- `docs/redesign/frozen-parity-baselines.md`

## Planning Target

Select exactly one next milestone candidate for post-M62 execution.

The selected candidate should advance the staged lowering direction:

```text
typed values
-> typed predicates
-> control-flow pruning
-> selected-body handoff
-> selected-body form recognition
-> unresolved selected-body IR
-> body-specific lowering
```

Compare lowering-focused candidates that could reasonably follow M62.
Potential directions include, but are not limited to:

- a next exact body-specific IR shape needed before direct-intrinsic semantics
- a small typed statement-sequence/body-envelope boundary that lets future body
  IR slices compose without a broad parser
- a first semantic lowering step that consumes M62 unresolved body IR while
  still avoiding backend translation and rendering
- a maintainability slice that keeps post-M62 body-lowering stages extendable
  without raw-text dispatchers
- a nearby generation-time lowering helper needed by the surrounding SVE array
  evidence, if it remains narrower and higher value than body-IR continuation

Treat all candidates as candidates, not as preaccepted. The planning result
must define:

- milestone title and number
- goal
- scope
- out-of-scope items
- required inputs from accepted milestones
- expected typed outputs
- validation criteria
- tests required
- evidence paths
- review risks
- next concrete prompt path

## Boundary Rules

The next milestone must remain one thin architectural slice.

Do not select a milestone that combines broad assignment semantics, direct
intrinsic semantics, SVE predicate semantics, vector metadata, backend
translation, rendering, output, or generated tests in one step.

Unless explicitly selected as the one thin slice, keep these out of scope:

- broad assignment, variable, declaration, array, call, cast, loop, store,
  return, or multi-statement body lowering
- broad direct `intrin<...>` semantics
- SVE predicate or vector/register semantics
- `value<generation>(vector::length)` or
  `value<generation>(vector::alignment)`
- backend uninit values
- backend translation expansion
- rendering or generated output
- generated tests
- CLI/reporting/writer behavior
- Rust
- compiler execution
- broad TSIL parsing
- runtime dependency on `frozen/`
- lowering-time file reads, raw TSL parsing, or catalog queries during
  evaluation

If a body-specific lowering candidate is selected, require it to consume typed
accepted stage outputs such as M62 body IR and to produce typed intermediate
values, not renderer-ready text or backend translation requests unless that
exact boundary is selected and justified.

## Required Subagent Workflow

Use read-only planning and audit subagents before finalizing the plan:

1. Lowering planner: compare lowering-focused next milestones and recommend
   one candidate.
2. Extensibility auditor: assess whether the candidate keeps the staged
   body-lowering pipeline maintainable and avoids broad dispatchers.
3. Boundary auditor: identify scope risks, especially body-specific lowering
   versus direct-intrinsic/SVE/backend/rendering work.
4. Evidence auditor: verify evidence paths and whether the candidate is
   supported by accepted M57-M62 behavior plus current corpus evidence.
5. Documentation auditor: check which roadmap/spec/testing docs need planning
   updates and whether stale M62 wording remains.

After local planning updates, run read-only review subagents:

1. Reviewer: use `docs/agent/review-checklist.md` and return `Accept`,
   `Accept With Follow-Ups`, `Needs Revision`, `Return To Planner`, or
   `Reject`.
2. Boundary re-review: confirm the selected plan remains one thin slice and
   does not start implementation.
3. Documentation re-review: confirm docs and workflow state match the selected
   planning result.

If review returns `Needs Revision`, perform only focused
documentation/planning revisions and run focused re-review. Do not implement
product code.

If review returns `Return To Planner` or `Reject`, stop and create the
appropriate next planning or rollback prompt under `docs/agent/runs/`.

## Required Repository Updates

Update planning documentation only as needed, usually:

- `docs/redesign/implementation-roadmap.md`
- `docs/redesign/generation-time-semantic-lowering.md`
- `docs/redesign/testing-strategy.md`
- `docs/redesign/behavioral-spec.md`
- `docs/redesign/pipeline-design.md`
- `docs/redesign/target-architecture.md`
- `docs/redesign/open-questions.md`
- `docs/redesign/design-decisions.md`
- `docs/redesign/frozen-parity-baselines.md`

Before finishing, update `docs/agent/current-redesign-state.md` and create the
next concrete prompt under `docs/agent/runs/`.

If the planning result is internally accepted and needs human acceptance before
execution, create:

```text
docs/agent/runs/post-m62-acceptance-finalization-prompt.md
```

That finalization prompt should convert human acceptance into the selected
milestone execution-review loop prompt. Do not start execution here.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

If the planning pass changes only a subset of docs, include any narrower
diff-check command that was useful, but the final validation must include the
full `git diff --check`.

## Final Report

Report:

1. Planning and review subagents used.
2. Selected milestone and why it advances lowering.
3. Files changed.
4. Consolidated planning review verdict.
5. Follow-ups recorded, if any.
6. Next prompt created.
7. State transition made.
8. Validation command and exact result.
9. Whether the repo is ready for the next action.
