# Current Redesign State

This file is the handoff state for Codex tasks. It is intentionally concise and
must be updated after accepted milestones, accepted documentation corrections,
or accepted planning passes.

## Accepted Through

Milestone 192 is accepted.

M188 added the accepted `supplementary/` layout and a small typed
static/template rendering boundary for deterministic C++ and Rust project
skeleton artifacts. The new `tslgen.rendering.supplementary` boundary consumes
typed `SupplementaryStaticAsset`, `SupplementaryTemplateAsset`, and
`ProjectSkeletonRenderContext` values and returns an in-memory `ArtifactSet`
plus diagnostics. It does not write files.

M188 template rendering uses Python standard-library formatting only and does
not introduce Jinja or another external template dependency. Templates may
format the typed presentation fields `backend_id`, `project_name`,
`artifact_path`, and `helper_manifest`; semantic-looking fields such as
primitive names, type tags, intrinsic names, TSIL/source payloads, feature
gates, dependency fields, selectors, and fallback fields are rejected before
formatting.

M188 deliberately did not ingest `tsldata/detail/lang/**`, translate backend
type/value/intrinsic/source-operation requests, move scalar/operator semantics
into templates, render primitive bodies beyond existing tiny outputs,
translate M185/M187 request islands, execute dependency closure, or make
`frozen/` or `tslgenold/` runtime dependencies.

M189 added typed machine feature profile values and a profile catalog loader
for `supplementary/buildsystem/machine_profiles.json`. The catalog normalizes
feature flags through `tsldata/detail/flags.tsl`, treats the `generic/scalar`
`NOSIMD-INVALID` spelling as a no-SIMD sentinel, preserves alternative
feature spellings as typed build/presentation metadata, and exposes selected
profile build option values. It deliberately does not model compiler support,
host autodetection, compiler-specific option spelling, compiler invocation,
backend semantic translation, primitive rendering, dependency closure, or
lowering.

M189 also extended `tsldata/detail/flags.tsl` with self-normalized
`avx512er` and `avx512pf` entries because the accepted product machine
profiles use those feature flags.

M190 added typed backend metadata values and an exact parser/loader for active
C++ and Rust backend language/type maps and translation templates under
`tsldata/detail/lang/**`. The active catalog stores C++ and Rust type
spellings and inert translation template text, including multiline Rust
`preamble` text, with deterministic ordering and diagnostics. C17 remains
deferred evidence. M190 deliberately did not evaluate snippets, render code,
replace backend emitters, change machine profiles, reopen lowering, execute
dependency closure, or add runtime dependencies on `frozen/` or `tslgenold`.

A documentation correction after M190 accepted ADR-055: backend/output work
must pass through dependency planning, backend translation, typed render
models, renderer/templates, an in-memory `ArtifactSet`, manifest-based
`ArtifactWriter`, and after-write `BuildVerifier`. Generated output uses a
run-level `generated/` tree with C++ `include/tsl.hpp` plus
`include/profiles/*.hpp`, Rust `src/lib.rs` plus `src/profiles/*.rs`, explicit
profile subsets defaulting to `scalar`, reserved `all` for all known profiles,
presentation-only templates, manifest-preserving cleanup, and verification of
every generated profile in the selected subset.

M191 added a typed generated-profile selection boundary over the M189 machine
feature profile catalog, typed C++/Rust generated-project render models,
profile-aware generated skeleton rendering, manifest-clean artifact writing,
and an after-write build verification boundary with injectable command
execution. The skeleton produces the ADR-055 `generated/cpp` and
`generated/rust` project layout, verifies every selected profile, skips only
dependent commands in a failed profile, and continues with later profiles and
backends. M191 did not render primitive bodies, translate backend
type/value/intrinsic/source-operation requests, evaluate backend translation
templates, map profile features to compiler target-feature options, execute
dependency closure, change lowering, or add runtime dependencies on `frozen/`
or `tslgenold`.

M192 added `tslgen.backends.type_spelling`, a typed backend translation
boundary that consumes accepted `BackendTypeSpellingRequest` values plus the
M190 backend metadata catalog. It resolves scalar identity requests through
active C++ and Rust language maps using explicit `si* -> s*` and `ui* -> u*`
normalization, resolves `LoweredSizeType()` through the exact `type_size`
translation metadata entry, and returns typed `BackendTranslatedTypeSpelling`
values with request and metadata provenance. M192 did not parse raw
`type<backend>(...)` text, render output, evaluate arbitrary templates,
fulfill vector/register/mask/generic/extension-transform requests, change
the generated-project skeleton/writer/verifier, execute dependency closure, or
add runtime dependencies on `frozen/` or `tslgenold`.

Post-lowering backend/output transition planning is accepted and selected M188
as the first backend/output milestone.

The post-M187 lowering completion gate is accepted and declared lowering
complete by current contract. The current `tsldata/**/*.tsl` corpus no longer
shows a lowering-owned gap that must be implemented before backend/output
planning. Remaining observed forms are already accepted typed facts, typed
semantic values, typed request islands, typed handoff values, source-owned
opaque tokens, catalog syntax such as `prim<...>`, accepted selector/type
payload syntax such as `Vec<...>`, backend metadata under
`tsldata/detail/lang/**`, source-authored `details::*` helpers,
backend/output translation or rendering obligations, or broad/deferred
parsing/source-repair work that lowering must not absorb by default.

## Current Work State

Current required action:

```text
Run M193 execution-review loop.
```

Active run prompt:

```text
docs/agent/runs/m193-execution-review-loop-prompt.md
```

Active planning milestone:

```text
Milestone 193: Backend Value Translation For Metadata-Only Requests.
```

Latest review verdict:

```text
M192 execution-review returned Accept after one write-capable executor and
read-only architecture/boundary, evidence, documentation, and validation
audits. Validation passed and validation-created `tslgen/` cache directories
were removed.
```

Next expected action:

```text
Run the active M193 execution-review loop prompt. It is an implementation
task: one write-capable executor consumes existing typed `BackendValueRequest`
values and the M190 backend metadata catalog to produce typed backend value
translation results for metadata-only uninit and constant requests. It must
not render code, evaluate arbitrary templates, broaden to suffix/prefix or
intrinsic composition, modify generated-project verification, or reopen
lowering.
```

Previous review verdict:

```text
M183 execution-review returned Accept. Post-M183 lowering planning returned
Accept and selected M184. M184 lowering completeness audit returned Accept
and selected M185. M185 execution-review returned Accept. Post-M185 lowering
completion gate planning returned Accept and selected M186. M186
execution-review returned Accept and selected a final post-M186 lowering
completion gate. Post-M186 lowering completion gate planning returned Accept
and selected M187. M187 execution-review returned Accept. Post-M187 lowering
completion gate planning returned Accept and declared lowering complete by
current contract. Post-lowering backend/output transition planning returned
Accept and selected M188. M188 execution-review returned Accept and selected
M189. M189 was then retargeted by planning decision to the machine feature
profile/buildsystem option boundary before execution. M189 execution-review
returned Accept and selected M190. M190 execution-review returned Accept and
selected M191. M191 was then retargeted by ADR-055 planning correction before
execution. M191 execution-review returned Accept and selected M192. M192
execution-review returned Accept and selected M193.
